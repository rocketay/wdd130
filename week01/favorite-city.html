    <h1>Escazu, My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>Escazú is a modern and vibrant city located just west of San José, the capital of Costa Rica. Known as one of the
        country’s most upscale areas, Escazú blends urban development with beautiful mountain views, offering a mix of
        luxury
        residences, shopping centers, fine dining, and international businesses. Its strategic location and high
        standard of
        living have made it a popular destination for both locals and expatriates.</p>
    <p>Beyond its modern lifestyle, Escazú is also rich in culture and tradition. Often called the “City of Witches” due
        to
        local folklore, it preserves historic churches, festivals, and a strong sense of community. The city provides a
        unique
        balance of modern amenities and cultural heritage, making it one of the most attractive and dynamic places to
        live or
        visit in Costa Rica.</p>
